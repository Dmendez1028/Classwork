    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Is a way pf generalizing details, such as attributes.</p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>Data is stored in a variable. Each variable has a name.</p>

    <h2>Pattern Recognition  </h2>
    <p>Pattern recognition is a process of finding repeating designs </p>

    <h2>Algorithmic Thinking</h2>
    <p>Algorithmic thinking is a method of breaking down complex problems into smaller steps for computers or humans</p>

    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <p>A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.</p>

    <h2>Conditional Statement</h2>
    <p>A conditional statement begins with an "if" statement to determain if an action should be taken.</p>

    <h2>Mathematic operations </h2>
    <p>A symbol that stands for carrying our or more mathematical operations on some date </p>

    <h2>Relational Operators</h2>
    <p>a relational operator is a programming language construct or operator that tests or defines some kind of relation between two entities..</p>

    <h2>Refactoring</h2>
    <p>Refactoring is the process of restructuring code, while not changing its original functionality..</p>

    <h2>asynchronous and synchronous</h2>
    <p>Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously. Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation depends on completing the one before it. Each task requires an answer before moving on to the next iteration</p>

    <h2>Logical Operators</h2>
    <p>A logical operator in computer science refers to a fundamental operation that performs logical calculations on two or more values and produces a result based on the truth values of the inputs.</p>

    <h2>Decomposition</h2>
    <p>breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller parts that are more manageable and easier to understand</p>
